Password Generator Documentation
Overview:
The generate_password function generates a secure, random password containing uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols. It leverages Python's built-in random and string modules to create a password of a specified length.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
random and string modules (both are part of Python’s standard library)

Functions:

generate_password(length=12)
Generates a random password of a specified length using letters, numbers, and special characters.

Parameters:

length (int, optional): The length of the generated password. Default is 12.
Returns:

str: A randomly generated password containing letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters.

How It Works:

Character Set: The function combines three sets of characters:
Letters (both uppercase and lowercase).
Digits (0-9).
Special symbols (e.g., !@#$%^&*()).
Random Selection: It uses random.choice() to randomly select characters from this combined set.
Password Generation: A password is built by repeating the random selection process for the specified length.

Considerations:
Security: The generated passwords are random, but for highly secure applications, consider using Python's secrets module, which provides more secure random number generation.
Length: The default password length is 12 characters. It’s recommended to use a password length of at least 12-16 characters for better security.# random-passwords
